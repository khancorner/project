How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It listed the difference  between the contents in both the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Since it lists down the differences, it can help in comparing large file and debug automatically instead of doing so manually.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros is that you can see for yourself which files to compare while at the same time it is a time-consuming process. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
